## ‚ùì What is AMIBCP?

AMIBCP (AMI BIOS Configuration Program) is a BIOS configuration utility that enables users to modify and adjust their motherboard's BIOS settings. It's commonly used for advanced users and system administrators to configure hidden or restricted BIOS settings, such as CPU overclocking, RAM settings, and more.

AMIBCP is widely used in the DIY computer-building community for fine-tuning the performance of motherboards and customizing their settings for specific hardware. It provides a detailed and user-friendly interface to make changes to BIOS, unlock hidden features, and optimize the BIOS for different system configurations.
